1. RECORD OF REVISIONS
Any revision to the present Manual, except actual weighing data, is recorded: a
Record of Revisions is provided at the front of this manual and the operator is ad-
vised to make sure that the record is kept up-to-date.
The Manual issue is identified by Edition and Revision codes reported on each
page, lower right side.
The revision code is numerical and consists of the number "0"; subsequent revi-
sions are identified by the change of the code from "0" to "1" for the first revision
to the basic publication, "2" for the second one, etc.
Should be necessary to completely reissue a publication for contents and format
changes, the Edition code will change to the next number (“2” for the second edi-
tion, “3” for the third edition etc).
Additions, deletions and revisions to existing text will be identified by a revision
bar (black line) in the left-hand margin of the page, adjacent to the change.
When technical changes cause expansion or deletion of text which results in un-
changed text appearing on a different page, a revision bar will be placed in the
right-hand margin adjacent to the page number of all affected pages providing no
other revision bar appears on the page.
These pages will be updated to the current regular revision date.
NOTE: It is the responsibility of the owner to maintain this handbook in a current
status when it is being used for operational purposes.

1. INTRODUCTION
Section 3 includes checklists and detailed procedures for coping with various
types of emergency conditions that could arise.
Before operating the aircraft, the pilot should become thoroughly familiar with
the present manual and, in particular, with the present Section. Further, a contin-
ued and appropriate training should be provided.
Two types of emergency procedures are hereby given:
a. “Bold faces” which must be known by heart and executed in the correct and com-
plete sequence, as soon as possible as the failure is detected and recognized;
These procedures characters are boxed and highlighted, as shown below:
BEFORE ROTATION: ABORT TAKE OFF
1. Throttle IDLE
2. Rudder Keep heading control
3. - -
4. - -
b. Other procedures which should be well theoretically know and mastered, but that are
not time critical and can be executed entering and following step by step the AFM
appropriate checklist.
In case of emergency the pilot should acts as follows:
1. Maintain aircraft control
2. Analyse the situation
3. Apply the pertinent procedure
4. Inform the Air Traffic Control if time and conditions permit
The following definitions apply:
Land as soon as possible: land without delay at the nearest
suitable area at which a safe approach and landing is as-
sured.
Land as soon as practical: land at the nearest approved
landing area where suitable repairs can be made.

7. INFLIGHT ENGINE RESTART
7.1. PROPELLER WINDMILLING
WARNING
In case of engine shutdown, propeller will keep windmilling and will
not stop, preventing the use of ignition key. Engine inflight restart
must be performed without using ignition key until propeller is
windmilling in order to avoid possible engine damages.
Typical indication of a potential engine shutdown, with windmilling
propeller, will be low RPM values incompatible with power lever
demand, to be confirmed by other engine instruments (OIL Pressure,
CHT, EGT running down abnormally).
Flight test results suggest a windmilling propeller speed as low as
600-500 RPM at low speeds in case of flameout.
Inflight engine restart may be performed during 1g flight anywhere
within the normal operating envelope of the airplane.

2. IFR FLIGHT: TRAINING PRE-REQUISITES AND INCREMENTAL EX-
POSITION TO G1000 SUITE
The aircraft is fully equipped with a Garmin G1000 avionic suite that integrates
radio aids navigation with GPS navigation, providing an outstanding capability to
support IFR flight, from basic instrument training to complex IFR scenario.
NOTE
Depending on national regulations, in some countries flying IFR with a single en-
gine aircraft without autopilot installation and/or single pilot may or may not be
allowed, any customer must pay careful attention to check limitations that may
apply.
The use of G1000 software requires full system knowledge (G1000 manual which
will also specify peculiar limitations), careful preparation, ground training on the
computer-assisted software and pre-flight training before flight.
Furthermore, as a minimum during training, it’s strongly recommended using the
avionic suite in IFR with incremental steps after initial basic IFR instruction:
1. Initial use of a single radio-aids (No GPS);
2. Use of two radio-aids (No GPS);
3. Use of GPS for point to point navigation (No approaches);
4. Use of VNAV feature;
5. Full use of avionic suite.
The flight training syllabus for IFR instruction will need to address this incremen-
tal approach in order to give pilots awareness of full avionic potential, and to
highlight the complexity of single pilot usage of G1000 Garmin suite while en-
route or high density airspace structure.
CAUTION
Due to precision required on IFR flight, the workload that may develop using full
avionic suite, may get excessive in single pilot without the aid of an autopilot.
Considering the complexity of the G1000 suite, sound judgment will be required
(weather, airspace complexity, pilot skills) to assess the best option of IFR steer
guidance.

Section 4 – Normal procedures
IFR FLIGHT: TRAINING PRE-REQUISITES AND INCREMENTAL
EXPOSITION TO G1000 SUITE
Page 4 - 5
NOTE
The necessity to correct or modify flight plans in the Garmin G1000 under these
conditions may distract pilots from basic handling causing deviations from as-
signed parameters, so careful attention must be exercised to avoid deviations on
flying parameters.
It’s highly recommended to continue cross-checking flight parameters when en-
tering flight data into the G1000, especially when trying to create / insert arrival
and departure procedures and / or VNAV profiles as the quantity of actions need-
ed is high and may distract pilots from basic and precise handling.
The following prescriptions, other than those already present in the G1000 manu-
al, shall be observed:
- Use of GPS for precision approach navigation mode is not allowed.
- Use of GPS is prohibited as primary means for navigation. GPS is approved as sup-
plemental means for navigation;
- Use of GPS is prohibited for IFR in terminal area or in non-precision approach op-
erations;
If Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) function becomes unavail-
able in en route phase of flight, position must be verified every 15 minutes using
other IFR approved navigation system.
Turbulence and / or crosswind:
Presence of moderate to heavy turbulence and / or strong crosswind conditions (above
20 kts crosswind) will require high drift angle to correct for wind (above 15° drift) and
highly reduce spare capabilities to do other concurrent tasks inside the cockpit other
than precise flying.

During climb, a rough method of correctly leaning is to slowly reduce mixture lever until an
increase of appr.ly 50-100 RPM is noticed at constant IAS or EGT reaches 1375°F mark.
1. Pitot HEAT: ON if required
2. Fuel pump: ON
3. Brakes: apply
4. Throttle: FULL and check approximately 2100  100 RPM
Engine proper performance at full throttle shall be checked early in the ground roll
in order to abandon take-off if necessary.
A rough engine, sluggish RPM increase or failure to reach take-off RPM are reasons
for abandoning the take-off. If the engine oil is cold, an oil pressure in the yellow sec-
tor is permissible.
5. Engine instruments: check parameters within the limits
6. Brakes: Release
7. Rotation speed VR: 60 KIAS

5.7. CLIMB
Due to position of fuel sensors, during climb fuel gauges in cockpit will indicate a fuel
quantity slightly lower than the real amount. Regaining level flight will immediately
restore correct indications.
For 5000ft density altitude and above, or high ambient temperatures, a FULL RICH
mixture may cause rough running of the engine or a loss of performance.
The mixture may be adjusted to obtain smooth engine operations.
Lean to maximum RPM at Full Throttle prior to take-off where airports are at 5000ft
density altitude or higher.
During climb, a rough method of correctly leaning is to slowly reduce mixture lever
until an increase of appr.ly 50-100 RPM is noticed at constant IAS or EGT reaches
1375°F mark.

5.8. CRUISE
1. Power: set performance as required, refer to table in section 5 of AFM
2. Fuel tank selector: as required to maintain symmetric balance
3. Mixture: set in accordance with following para 5.9
NOTE
NOTE
To optimize engine life, the cylinder head temperature (CHT) should lie
between 150°F and 400°F in continuous operation, and not rise above
435°F in fast cruise.
Monitor and manually compensate asymmetrical fuel consumption by
switching fuel selector valve. Switch ON the electric fuel pump prior to
swap the fuel feeding from one tank to another.
5.9. MIXTURE ADJUSTMENT RECOMMENDATION
CAUTION
The maximum permissible cylinder head temperature (500 °F) must never be ex-
ceeded.
The mixture control lever should always be moved slowly.
Before selecting a higher power setting the mixture control lever should, on each
occasion, be moved slowly to fully RICH before throttle adjustment.
Care should always be taken that the cylinders do not cool down too quickly.
The cooling rate should not exceed 50 °F per minute.
For maximum service life cylinder head temperature should be kept below 475 °F
(high performance cruise) and below 435 °F (for economy cruise).
NOTE
Best Cruise Economy Mixture
The best economy mixture setting may only be used up to a power setting of 75 %. In order to obtain
the lowest specific fuel consumption at a particular power setting, proceed as follows:
- Slowly pull the mixture control lever back towards LEAN until the engine starts to run rough-
ly.
- Then push the mixture control lever forward just far enough to restore smooth running. At the
same time the exhaust gas temperature (EGT) should reach a maximum.
Best Cruise Power Mixture
The mixture can be set for maximum performance at all power settings:
- The mixture should first be set as for best economy.
- The mixture should then be enriched until the exhaust gas temperature is approximately
100°F lower.
This mixture setting produces the maximum performance for a given manifold pressure
and is mainly used for high power settings (approximately 75 %).

5.10. DESCENT
NOTE
Due to position of fuel sensors, during descent fuel gauges in cockpit will indicate a fuel
quantity slightly higher than the real amount. Regaining level flight will immediately re-
store correct indications.
NOTE
1. Mixture control: slowly full rich
2. Throttle: reduce as required
Shock cooling shortens engine life.
When reducing power, the change in cylinder head temperature should not exceed 50°F
per minute. In order to ensure best practice and avoid potential illumination of ALT FAIL
(due to low propeller speed), the following best practice should be observed:
- Reducing power to maintain a minimum descent speed of 85 KIAS (best glide) and / or
a blade angle to maintain 850 RPM;
- Opening the ALTER AIR command to full open (to avoid ice accretion).
CAUTION
The maximum permissible cylinder head temperature (500 °F) must never be exceeded.
The mixture control lever should always be moved slowly.
Before selecting a higher power setting the mixture control lever should, on each occasion,
be moved slowly to fully RICH.
Care should always be taken that the cylinders do not cool down too quickly. The cooling
rate should not exceed 50 °F per minute.

1. INTRODUCTION
This section describes the procedure for establishing the basic empty weight and
the moment of the aircraft. Loading procedure information is also provided.
NOTE
Aircraft must be operated in accordance with the limits con-
cerning the maximum takeoff weight and CG excursion as re-
ported in Flight Manual Section 2.
Pilot is responsible for checking the weight and CG excursion are compliant with
the related limits. CG excursion and weight limits are reported in Section 2 – Lim-
itations.

INTRODUCTION
Page 6 - 4
2. WEIGHING PROCEDURES
2.1. PREPARATION
- Carry out weighing procedure inside closed hangar
- Remove from cabin any object unintentionally left
- Make sure Flight Manual and mandatory documents are on board
- Align nose wheel
- Drain fuel via the specific drain valve
- Oil and hydraulic fluid at the operating levels
- Move sliding seats to most forward position
- Raise flaps to fully retracted position
- Place control surfaces in neutral position
- Place scales (min. capacity 300 kg (661.4 lb)) under each wheel
2.2. LEVELLING
- Level the aircraft (the reference for longitudinal levelling is made putting a
spirit-level on the cabin floor as shown in the Aircraft Maintenance Manual).
- Adjust longitudinal attitude deflating nose tire
2.3. WEIGHING
- Record weight shown on each scale
- Repeat weighing procedure three times
- Calculate empty weight
2.4. DETERMINATION OF C.G. LOCATION
- Drop a plumb bob tangent to the wing leading edge and trace a reference mark
on the floor (see Figure on Para. 2.5 or 2.6)
- Repeat the operation for other wing
- Stretch a taught line between the two marks
- Measure the distance between the reference line and both main and nose wheel
axis (A and B distances respectively)
- Using recorded data it is possible to determine the aircraft C.G. location and the
aircraft moment (see following table)

1. INTRODUCTION
This section provides description and operation of the aircraft and its systems.
2. AIRFRAME
P2010’s airframe can be divided in the following main groups, as highlighted below on fig-
ure 7-1:
1) Wing
2) Fuselage
3) Empennage
4) Landing gear

Fig. 7-1. P2010 AIRFRAME
2.1. WING
Each wing is connected to the fuselage by means of two bolt attachments and a single strut
brace per side. The wings are made up of a central light alloy torsion box; a light alloy lead-
ing edge is attached to the front spar whereas the flap (“slotted”) and the aileron (“frise”) are
attached to a rear spar through two hinges each.
The torsion box consists of a front and rear spar that represent its front and rear vertical
walls; a series of ribs and wrap-around panels complete the structure. Front and rear spars
are integrated with wing-fuselage attachment fittings.
Integral fuel tanks are located in the wing box, behind the main spar, with a capacity of 120
litres each (31,7 gallons).
The ailerons and flaps are made by an aluminium spar attached to a formed sheet metal
leading edge and metal ribs; an aluminium skin surrounds the aileron structure.

AIRFRAME
Page 7 - 3
2.2. FUSELAGE
The P2010 fuselage is mainly made by carbon fibres composite materials.
The fuselage is made by two main shells that are later assembled bonding the two main bod-
ies and the floor (composite) and adding aluminium parts that allow the connection of the
main landing gear, seats, wing and instrument panel.
Fuselage and vertical fin are thus a unique body.
2.3. EMPENNAGES
2.3.1. HORIZONTAL TAIL
The horizontal tail is an all-moving type; the stabilizer and elevator form a single uniform
plane called stabilator that rotates to the desired pitch setting.
The stabilator structure (see Figure 7-2) is made-up by two aluminium spar and ribs.
Aluminium skin panels are riveted to the above elements.
A trim tab provides stick force adjustment and longitudinal compensation through a control
wheel located between pilot and co-pilot seats.

2.4. MAIN LANDING GEAR
The main landing gear consists of two steel leaf-springs positioned crossways to the fuse-
lage.
Fig. 7-4. MAIN LANDING GEAR STRUCTURE
The steel leaf-springs are attached to the fuselage structure on composite beams.
Wheels are cantilevered on gear struts and feature hydraulically actuated disc brakes con-
trolled by toe. Main gear wheels install type 6.00-6 tires inflated at 36 psi (2.5 bar).
P2010 is provided with an independent hydraulically actuated brake system for each main
wheel. A master cylinder is attached to each pilot’s rudder pedal. Hydraulic pressure, ap-
plied via the master cylinders, enters the brake via lines connected to an inlet fitting on the
caliper.
A parking brake valve, mounted in correspondence of the cabin floor and operated by a
knob on the cockpit central pedestal, intercepts the hydraulic lines, once pressurized by toe
brakes, to hold the brake assemblies linings tightened round the main wheels brake discs.
Brakes can be operated from either pilot’s and co-pilot’s pedals: a single vented oil reservoir
feeds the pilot side master cylinders which are connected, via hoses, with the co-pilot’s side
ones.

3. FLIGHT CONTROLS
Aircraft flight controls are operated through conventional stick and rudder pedals. Longitu-
dinal control acts through a system of push-rods and is equipped with a trim tab. a cable
control circuit is confined within the cabin and it is connected to a pair of push-pull rod sys-
tems positioned in each main wing which control ailerons differentially. Aileron trimming is
carried out on ground through a small tab positioned on left aileron.
Flaps are extended via an electric servo actuator controlled by a switch on the instrument
panel. Flaps act in continuous mode; the indicator displays three markings related to 0°,
takeoff (T/O) and landing (FULL) positions. A breaker positioned on the right side of the
instrument panel protects the electric circuit.
The control of the stabilator trim is operated by means of a control wheel, located between
the two front seats that acts directly on the control cables.
Stabilator trim position is displayed on a dedicated analogue indicator located on the LH ar-
ea of the instrument panel.
Rudder Trimming device for lateral control is provided by means of an electrical actuator
controlled by a rocker switch located near the pitch trim wheel; the surface is connected to a
potentiometer linked to a rudder trim indicator included in the Garmin G1000 EIS (Engine
Indication System).

4.1. ENGINE CONTROL LEVER
Engine handling is via three levers: Throttle, RPM lever, Mixture control lever.
They’re situated on the center control; the use of “front/forward” and “rear/backward”
is defined in relation to the direction of flight (longitudinal).
Mixture control lever
This lever (right hand lever with red handle) controls the fuel-air mixture, which is
supplied to the engine.
With the lever full forward, extra fuel is being supplied to the engine which at higher
performance setting contributes to engine cooling.
In cruise, the mixture should be made leaner in order to reach the appropriate fuel-air
mixture. The leaning procedure is given in Chapter 4.
Lever forward (RICH) >> Mixture rich (in fuel)
Lever to rear (LEAN) >>Mixture lean (in fuel)
To shut off the engine the mixture control lever is pulled to the rear stop: air without
fuel is drawn into the cylinders that shuts down.
Throttle
This lever (left hand with large knob) is used to control manifold pressure (MAP).
High manifold pressure means a large quantity of fuel-air mixture is being supplied to
engine, while low manifold pressure means a lesser quantity of fuel-air mixture is be-
ing supplied.

4.2. ALTERNATE AIR
Alternate Air knob is located on the central pedestal; when the knob is fully pulled
outward from the instrument panel, injectors receive maximum hot air. During normal
operation, the knob is set in OFF position.
4.3. DEFROST AND CABIN HEAT
Two knobs, located on the lower side of the central pedestal, allow Defrost and Cabin
Heat function. The one marked as “Defrost and Cabin Heat” allows hot air to perform
windshield defrost and partially cabin heat.
The cabin heat control knob, when fully outward, allows cabin to receive maximum
hot air. When both cabin heat and defrost and cabin heat are pulled, air is partitioned.

Each fuel tank is integrated within the wing box. The capacity of each tank is 120
liters (31,7 gal.), total capacity is thus 240 liters (63.4 gal.).
The internal side of fuel tank is accessible for inspection through 4 upper dedicat-
ed caps.
Two bottom inspection panels allow the inspection of vent line and tank structure.
An anti-sloshing movable wall is located within each fuel tank, this prevents fuel
centrifugation which is a possible cause of undesired engine shut down.
The fuel tank filler cap is located on the top of the wing, in the area outside of the
tank and it is easily accessible from the leading edge of the aircraft. At the lowest
point of the tank it is positioned a drain sump.
The engine is equipped with an engine gear pumps, mechanical (primary). An ad-
ditional auxiliary electrical fuel pump is provided (auxiliary).
The fuel selector is operated by a fuel selector control knob located in the cabin on
the central panel. The fuel selector control and the fuel valve are connected via a
rigid control rod.

rated of 70 Amps @ 2700 rpm. During normal operations, it recharges the battery.
Secondary DC power is provided by a lead type battery (GILL G-247) which pro-
vides the energy necessary for feeding the essential electrical loads in the event of
an alternator failure.
The switch between the energy sources is automatic and no action is required in
order to activate the alternate energy source.
For ground maintenance and/or starting, an external power socket is provided.
The alternator and battery are connected to the battery bus in order to provide en-
ergy for the electric equipment.
Each electrically fed instrument is connected to a dedicated circuit breaker which
protects the cable from the battery bus to the associated electric equipment.
WARNING

9.2. AVIONICS
The avionic system installed on P2010 is mainly based on the integrated avionic
suite Garmin G1000. The installed configuration is based on a two-screen layout.
Primary flight information are displayed on the LH screen, namely PFD (Primary
Flight Display).
Primary Engine and moving map information are displayed on the RH display,
namely MFD (Multi-Function Display).
Both communication and navigation means, including the ones provided by third
party units (i.e. ADF and DME), are integrated within the suite and their related
information are displayed on both PFD and MFD.
In the event of a PFD or MFD failure the “reversionary mode” is automatically
enabled.
In the event of a failure of the automatic reversion logic, the pilot can force rever-
sionary mode by pressing “reversionary mode” button marked in red and located
on the audio-panel.
When reversionary mode is activated primary flight and engine information are
presented together on the remaining display.
In order to provide the pilot with main flight information in the event of a dual
display failure of both PFD and MFD, or in the event of an AHRS and ADC units
combined failure, an integrated digital stand-by instrument, Mid-Continent MD-
302, featuring airspeed, altitude, attitude and slip information is installed.
A dedicated analogue indicator is provided for pitch trim position.
The installed equipment is such that the aircraft is able to fly under day/night VFR
and day/night IFR rules and to perform ILS CAT I approaches with ILS.

topilot suite manufactured by Garmin and identified as GFC 700. This autopilot
suite was designed as an option for the G1000 integrated flight deck. The autopi-
lot is controlled via dedicated keys grouped in a control panel located on the
MFD. The installed MFD display is different with respect to standard P2010 con-
figuration since it is GDU 1044.
The autopilot suite installed on P2010 is based on the following configuration:
 1 Roll servo
 1 Pitch servo
 1 Pitch Trim servo
Neither yaw axis nor rudder trim tab control is provided.
The autopilot is connected to electric system through the below listed circuit
breakers connected to the avionics bus:
1) A/P (5A)
2) PITCH TRIM (3A)
The installed servos are capstan type and are composed of two main components:
 A servo motor
 A servo capstan including the servo clutch
The following block diagram describes the avionic system installed on P2010 and
its interconnections with the autopilot servos:

The multifunction display (MFD) provides the pilot with a dedicated set of keys for autopilot
control (see red frame in the below picture).
The roll servo is located under the pilot seat and is fixed to a/c structure using a
dedicated mount. Pitch and pitch trim servos are located in the tail cone and are
installed on a dedicated mount which hosts both the servos.

GFC 700 is an integrated autopilot since it uses several information provided by
other units embodied in the G1000 avionics suite in order to compute the maneu-
vers to be performed by the aeroplane and actuate them. The below table lists the
functions which are required in order to have the GFC 700 operational and the
G1000 LRUs responsible for providing it:

Trim functionality 
In control of the roll axis, the autopilot senses turn rate, as well as closure rate to
the selected course, along with the non-rate quantities of heading error, course er-
ror and course deviation indication.
In control of the pitch axis, the autopilot senses vertical speed, acceleration, and
closure rate to the selected glideslope, along with the non-rate quantities of alti-
tude and glideslope deviation indication.
The ―autotrim‖ function senses when the aircraft needs to be trimmed about the
pitch axis, and responds by driving the trim servo in the proper direction to pro-
vide trim.

12.1 GDU 1044 (MFD)
GDU 1044 MFD unit can display as default engine parameters and moving map
information, along with other information that can be selected by the pilot (see the
first figure below); when reversionary mode is active it will display flight parame-
ters (in the form of PFD with the left strip engine information, as can be seen in
the second figure below). It is the user interface for P2010 avionics suite. GDU
1044 unit replaces the GDU 1040 unit on instrument panel RH side (MFD).
GDU 1044 (MFD)
Reversionary mode:
- In the event of a single display failure the system is able to automatically
switch the critical information including flight and engine parameters on the
remaining display presenting them in a compact view. In the event of a failure
of the automatic switch logic, the pilot can easily force the reversionary mode
by pressing the red button on the bottom of the audio panel thus getting both
flight and engine parameters information, necessary for continued safe flight,
on the remaining display.
